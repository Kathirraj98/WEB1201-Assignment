Hello visitor!<br>
<br>
This is repository for Web Fundamentals group assignment where we create fully functional eCommerce website. Previously we have discussed and made coffee beans as our product of choice. In this project we are going to use <b>Figma</b> for website's content and navigation mock up, <b> HTML, CSS</b> for Front-End development and <b>JavaScript, PHP</b> for back-end development. We are required to create our website <i>without usage of any additional libraries or frameworks</i>, in other words, all codes have to be written from scratch.
According to Planning Document sample, clearly defined plan determines the following:
a) Scope of the project
b) Technical activities

Our plan entities:
A) To create a fully functional eCommerce Website that is dedicated to selling coffee beans.
B) First of all we create initial mock up of the Website. Using Figma, we are going to draw menu, content and other parts of the site. Then we are going to project technical architecture, navigation, design, content and quality attibutes. After projecting is done, our group will start developing script, creating pages, insterting design attributes and coding the core functionality for the website development. When the script and other attributes of the website are written, we will proccess to test it's navigation, functionality and usability. In case any errors are discovered during testing phase, our group will process to fix the mistakes and test again until no further errors are detected. Finally, after finishing the testing phase, our group members will deploy the website and live happily afterwards.  
C) Our process output is a functional and accessible website with an excellent design for students, office workers and any other people who love to drink coffee, have coffee machines, and are willing to order the coffee beans from the internet.
