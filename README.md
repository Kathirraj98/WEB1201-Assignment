## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This is repository for Web Fundamentals group assignment where we create fully functional eCommerce website. Previously we have discussed and made coffee beans as our product of choice.

## 🏁 Scope of the project <a name = "scope"></a>

 Our website aims to create a fully functional eCommerce Website that is dedicated to selling coffee beans and provide excellent service for our customers.

## ⛏️ Built Using <a name = "built_using"></a>

What things we going to use in order to build the website:

- Figma
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP
<br>
<b>Clarification</b>
We are going to use <b>Figma</b> for website's content and navigation mock up, <b> HTML, CSS</b> for Front-End development and <b>JavaScript, PHP</b> for back-end development. We are required to create our website <i>without usage of any additional libraries or frameworks</i>, in other words, all codes have to be written from scratch.

## 🔧 Technical activities <a name = "technical_activities"></a>
 First of all we create initial mock up of the Website. Using Figma, we are going to draw menu, content and other parts of the site. Then we are going to project <i>technical architecture, navigation, design, content</i> and <i>quality attibutes</i>. After projecting is done, our group will start developing <i>script, creating pages, insterting design attributes</i> and <i>coding the core functionality</i> for the website development. When the script and other attributes of the website are written, we will proccess to test it's <i>navigation, functionality and usability</i>. In case any errors are discovered during testing phase, our group will process to <i>fix</i> the mistakes and test again until no further errors are detected. Finally, after finishing the testing phase, our group members will <i>deploy the website and live happily afterwards</i>.

## 🧭 Process output <a name="output"></a>

Our process output is a functional and accessible website with an excellent design for students, office workers and any other people who love to drink coffee, have coffee machines, and are willing to order the coffee beans from the internet.
