Hello visitor!<br>
<br>
This is repository for Web Fundamentals group assignment where we create fully functional eCommerce website. Previously we have discussed and made coffee beans as our product of choice. In this project we are going to use <b>Figma</b> for website's content and navigation mock up, <b> HTML, CSS</b> for Front-End development and <b>JavaScript, PHP</b> for back-end development. We are required to create our website <i>without usage of any additional libraries or frameworks</i>, in other words, all codes have to be written from scratch.
